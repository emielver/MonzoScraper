Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims across the world, and it consists of constant prayer and fasting throughout the whole day. Itâ€™s a time when everyone tries to make the most out of the month and change for the better after Ramadan ends.
So before Ramadan started, I sat down and thought about what Iâ€™d like to change about myselfâ€¦ my foul mouth.
Swearing is obviously frowned upon, but using swear words had become a part of my daily life and I didnâ€™t want to carry this on during the holy month.
So I had an idea: I created a â€˜swearing potâ€™ on Monzo. I vouched to myself that every time I swore Iâ€™d add Â£1 into my swearing pot. Then at the end of Ramadan, Iâ€™d give the total amount of money away to charity.

so I made a swearing pot on monzo. this ramadan every time I say a bad word Iâ€™m adding Â£1 to the pot. at the end of the month Iâ€™m giving it to charityðŸ¥º pic.twitter.com/x5IYKTooX1â€” intÃ­ (@mscrispss) 6 May 2019


Hereâ€™s how I got on:
Date: May 6th, Day 1 of Ramadan
Why I swore: Told my friend about my idea and she thought my total was going to end up being Â£100, so I cussed her out. Also went to Tescoâ€™s with her and ended swearing a couple more timesâ€¦ Friends donâ€™t help at all.
Running total: Â£4



There goes another Â£1
Date: May 7th
Why I swore: So I forgot about my idea and ended up using swear words as descriptive words. This consisted of describing how good the food I was going to break my fast with tasted, but in a more dramatic way.
Running total: Â£7 â€“ at this point I was rethinking my idea.

yaâ€™ll I was with @leylaaaj for 30 mins and suddenly Â£4 went out of my accountâ€” intÃ­ (@mscrispss) 6 May 2019


Date: May 8th
Why I swore: Took another trip to Tescoâ€™s. I was fasting and wanted to get my favourite crisps which are always on offer. Not this time though, full price Â£1.99. I was so annoyed, and fasting didnâ€™t help.
Running total: Â£9
"I was annoyed, and fasting didn't help"



Finally breaking the fast
Date: May 9th
Why I swore: Itâ€™s exam season and all I could think about was deadlines upon deadlines, and how I havenâ€™t revised. But I couldnâ€™t revise without snacks, see my problem? Being stressed resulted in a foul mouth.
Running total: Â£12, I was literally on the verge of giving up my idea.



Exam revision means another Â£1
Date: May 10th
Why I swore: Still at university trying to do my work, left the building to go home and realised I left my MacBook charger. Googled how much a MacBook charger is and almost fainted. Decided to take the train back to university with some hope. I ran into the room and saw my charger in the same place. A rollercoaster of emotions.
Running total: Â£14
"Realised I left my Macbook charger at home. Googled how much a charger is and almost fainted"
Date: May 11th-12th
Why I swore: One word: retail. I feel like thatâ€™s enough to describe the reason why my pot increased. My fellow people who work in retail will understand.
Running total: Â£17



If you know, you know
Date: May 13th-14th
Why I swore: At this point I was a week into my swearing pot plan and I was getting a little better. But I stepped on my nephewâ€™s toy and my life flashed before my eyes.
Running total: Â£16
"I stepped on my nephewâ€™s toy and my life flashed before my eyes"
Date: May 15th
Why I swore: The reason? My FRIENDS. These girls were deciding which restaurant to go to. Yet again, like they always do, they asked me. Why am I always the one deciding where to eat? Leave me alone.
Running total: Â£17

I hate my friends just wanna let you lot know. My pot is going to increase Â£Â£Â£Â£ along with my blood pressure.â€” intÃ­ (@mscrispss) 13 May 2019


Date: May 16th-17th
Why I swore: At this point, the only thing that could make my pot increase was university. Midway through exams and assignments. Not understanding a topic was irritating, no snacks was still a problem.
Running total: Â£19
"Not understanding a topic was irritating, no snacks was still a problem"
Date: May 18th-19th
Why I swore: Back to my retail job on the weekend. For some reason I forget about my swearing pot when working. Rude customers and fasting do not go together, so of course the pot increased.
Running total: Â£22
"Rude customers and fasting do not go together"
Date: May 20th-21st
Why I swore: Not much happened today, nephew spat up on my new hoodie. Thatâ€™s about it.
Running total: Â£23

Yo why is fasting getting harder and harder?????????â€” intÃ­ (@mscrispss) 20 May 2019


Date: May 22nd
Why I swore: Today was the last day of my exams and I walked straight into the shopping centre to buy myself a skateboard. I wanted to try out something new. But learning how to skateboard definitely added a few pound coins into my pot. Itâ€™s not easy at all.
Running total: Â£25



Spoiler alert: skateboarding is not easy
My friends really enjoyed the idea of telling me to add to my pot every time I slipped up. But thatâ€™s what makes me more aware of how bad my habit of swearing is, which then teaches me to shut my mouth. Iâ€™ve planned to keep using this idea in the future, regardless of Ramadan ending.
After creating my pot and tweeting about it, a lot of people came forward and decided to go through with the same idea. I chose to title my pot a â€˜swearing potâ€™ but others came up with naming their pot based on something they would like to work on for themselves personally.

Amazing doing this too thanks https://t.co/6xandWXLGMâ€” Ù„Ø¨Ù†Ù‰ (@XXVIIR) 6 May 2019


Weâ€™re now on the last day of Ramadan now and I feel like Iâ€™ve improved. But letâ€™s just see if it lasts!
