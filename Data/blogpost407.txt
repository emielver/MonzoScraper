Position: Head of Marketing and Community

As of this weekend, more than a quarter of a billion pounds has been spent through Monzo cards by more than two hundred thousand customers! This is a number we could never have imagined we’d be announcing just three and a half months after reaching one hundred thousand customers and it is all down to the amazing Monzo community and the wonderful team at Monzo HQ.



We can’t wait to welcome many more people to Monzo over the coming months, both on our Beta prepaid cards and on the Monzo current account later this year. The waiting list to get a card is now just one week, so if you haven’t taken the plunge yet: now’s your chance!
Thank you to everyone who has helped us get this far and here’s to the next milestone on our journey together ❤️
