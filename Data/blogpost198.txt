A bank statement is a summary of the transactions on your account over a certain period of time.
You might need one if youâ€™re filing your taxes or submitting expenses. Banks also ask you for statements when youâ€™re applying for a mortgage or a loan. Or if youâ€™re renting a home, your agent or landlord might want to see one.
