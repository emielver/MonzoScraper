Author: Team Monzo
Position: Monzo HQ
Date: 5 Dec 2018


We opened crowdfunding to existing investors on Monday, and theyâ€™ve helped us raise more than Â£2,000,000 so far. But weâ€™re raising up to Â£20,000,000, and now itâ€™s your turn!
If youâ€™re eligible, you can now invest up to Â£2,000 through the Monzo app. Open your Monzo app to get started!
And if youâ€™re new to crowdfunding, our guide explains how it works and some of the risks that come with it.
Thanks to all our customers, existing investors and the new ones whoâ€™ll join us over the next few days. Weâ€™re incredibly grateful for your support, and so glad to have you on board! ðŸš€
