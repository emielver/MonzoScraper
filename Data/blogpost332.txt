Weâ€™ll soon be bringing the Monzo Beta to an end, meaning prepaid Monzo cards will stop working on 4th April. To keep using Monzo, youâ€™ll have to upgrade your account.
You can see a simple summary of the benefits of upgrading in this table, and in the meantime weâ€™ve answered one more of your common questions: are overdrafts optional?
The short answer
Overdrafts are 100% optional. If you upgrade your Monzo account, you wonâ€™t have one by default.



The long answer
If you donâ€™t want an overdraft, you donâ€™t need to do anything. We donâ€™t give you one automatically, which means upgrading wonâ€™t affect your credit score.
If your account is empty and you donâ€™t have an overdraft, weâ€™ll keep rejecting payments for free, just like we do now. The only exceptions are â€˜offlineâ€™ payments, like those you make to Transport for London (TfL). We canâ€™t reject these, but weâ€™ll let you know if they take your balance below zero. Youâ€™ll have until midnight to add money to your account, so you can avoid charges or any impact on your credit score.
If you do want to use an overdraft, youâ€™ll need to actively switch it on in the app. Youâ€™ll only have the option to do this if youâ€™re eligible for an overdraft, and have already upgraded your Monzo account.



Weâ€™re in the process of giving more of our customers the option to use an overdraft if they want. If youâ€™re interested, you can find out more about Monzo overdrafts on this dedicated page.
