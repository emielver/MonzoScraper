This year has been pretty exciting so far and today is no exception. We’re proud to announce we’ve just reached 100,000 users!
It’s great timing, our 2nd birthday is just round the corner and we’re close to reaching £100,000,000 spent on Monzo cards too.
We’ll save you a slice of cake! 🍰
The honour goes to Robbie Mecrow from Nottingham. He’s officially our 100,000th user and we’re very proud to share this achievement with him! He joined Monzo after hearing about the instant spending notifications and fee free transactions abroad. Welcome to Monzo, Robbie!
A huge thanks to the other 99,999 of you! Heaps of praise goes to our wonderful team who have packed and sealed every single card, by hand, here at Monzo HQ.
Here’s to the next 100,000 users and beyond 🍸
