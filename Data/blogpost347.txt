Weâ€™ve just invited all our users to  upgrade their Monzo accounts, and over recent weeks many of you have been asking what makes upgrading better than sticking with your old card.
There are a bunch of benefits that come with upgrading your account, as well as all the familiar features.
The main difference is that youâ€™ll get an account number and sort code, so you can set up Direct Debits and standing orders, make bank transfers and get your salary paid straight in. Plus youâ€™ll have access to features only available on upgraded accounts, like  Android Pay and Pots!
What stays the same is that youâ€™ll still have access to Monzo-to-Monzo payments, instant spending notifications, built-in budgeting, and be able to top up your account from another debit card.
If you want, you can continue to use your new, upgraded Monzo debit card in exactly the same way as your existing prepaid card: add money to it every week, spend until Â£0, then top it up again. We wonâ€™t charge you any fees, and an overdraft is totally optional.
