There’s a chill in the air. The shops are getting busier. It’s suddenly acceptable to wear a jumper with sparkles.
Oh, right, it’s December. Time to launch the first Monzo shopping event! 🛍
Monzo x Old Street
Old Street has been our home since we launched in 2015 and we’ve grown to love the wide range of local, independent businesses that make it such a unique destination.
Looking at the spending stats, it seems that those of you who live in London are pretty fond of this neck of the woods too. Since launching our Alpha cards a year ago, almost £2.5m has been spent on Monzo in this area alone.



To celebrate, until the end of this week we’re partnering with a selection of our favourite independent stores and cafes to offer you something a bit special when you pay with Monzo. Thirteen lovely merchants are on board – whether you’re looking for beautiful gifts for family or friends, or just want to treat yourself, there’s something for everyone.
The participating merchants? Grab a drink or a bite to eat at Fix Coffee, Shoreditch Grind, Lantana, Bel-Air or Albion. Shop beautiful fashion at Kestin Hare, Article and Wonderound. Get great gifts from Murdock London (mens’ grooming products), Mast Brothers (chocolate), UrbanEars (headphones) and Tokyo Bike. Want hot coral nails or hair to match your Monzo card? Try The Painted Lady.
Find out more
We’ve put together a neighbourhood map online detailing all the offers available when you pay with Monzo between the 5th and 11th of December.
We’ll also be hanging around Old Street station over the next few days, handing out fancy printed maps. Pick one up and you’ll find a full list of the promotions and discounts – there’s also a pretty special competition available to anyone with a printed map, so well worth picking one up…
Watch out, Monzo’s about 👀
Not only do we want to offer our existing users a little treat, we want to make sure those who haven’t heard of Monzo get the opportunity to sign up and enjoy an early Christmas pressie from us! We’ll be in the area every day this week with maps, stickers and plenty of other Monzo goodies, spreading the word. Come and say ‘hi’!
Plus, on Wednesday night, we’ll be hosting after-hours drinks from 7pm at everyone’s favourite coffee shop and cocktail bar, Shoreditch Grind. If you’ve yet to try their legendary espresso martinis, prepare to have your mind blown 💥
For more details, and for your chance to win special prizes from our favourite merchants, follow the event throughout the week on Twitter using #oldstreetmonzo.
We’re going on tour
We haven’t forgotten about the tens of thousands of Monzonauts living outside London either 🙂
We’re planning a road trip in March 2017, popping up in several major UK cities. Tell us where we should go by Tweeting us at @monzo using #bringmemonzo. We’ll be announcing dates and venues in the first weeks of January (so stay tuned!)
