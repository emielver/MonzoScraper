Weâ€™ll be around to answer your questions, process your payments, and help you pay in your cheques over Christmas.
Customer support
Itâ€™s business as usual for customer support over Christmas, so you can reach out to us 24/7 over the holidays.
You might have to wait a little longer for an answer, but weâ€™ll be on hand every day working to help you as soon as we can.
Payments
Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Yearâ€™s Day are all bank holidays, which will affect how long it takes some of your payments to go through.
We wonâ€™t process your Direct Debits and Direct Credits on bank holidays, so theyâ€™ll go through on the next working day instead.
You can pay cheques into your Monzo account by posting them to us for free. Write your account number clearly on the back of the cheque and put Freepost Monzo on the envelope. Just pop it in the post â€“ no need to add a stamp!
Weâ€™ll add the money to your account five working days after we receive them, but it might take a bit longer if you send them in the week before Christmas.
Weâ€™ll process all your other payments as normal.
New and replacement debit cards
New Monzo cards typically arrive in a few working days, but theyâ€™re likely to take a little longer over the holidays. Thanks for your patience and rest assured theyâ€™re on their way!

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from everyone here at Monzo HQ! ðŸŽ„
