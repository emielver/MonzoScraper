Title: You can now open an ISA through your Monzo app ðŸŽ‰
Author: Moshe Raphaely
Position: Product Manager
Date: 4 Apr 2019


Weâ€™re excited to announce that you can now open a cash ISA (Individual Savings Account) through the Monzo app! Weâ€™ve teamed up with OakNorth so you can open an ISA and save money, without paying tax on the interest you earn.
Weâ€™re launching them in time for you to deposit money before the end of tax year deadline (which is Friday 5th April).
Youâ€™ll need to deposit a minimum of Â£500 to open one. In both the current and next tax year (2018â€“19 and 2019-20), youâ€™ll be able to pay up to Â£20,000 per tax year into your ISA. But, you can only open one cash ISA per tax year.
Weâ€™ve launched with an interest rate of 1.14%. OakNorth will pay you the interest youâ€™ve earned on the last working day of each month.
In future, weâ€™ll be launching fixed savings options and ISAs, to give you higher interest rates on money you put away for a fixed amount of time.
How to open an ISA in the Monzo app

Head to the Account tab in your app
Tap â€˜Create Potâ€™
Select â€˜Flexible Savings Potâ€™
Tap â€˜Open a Savings Pot ISAâ€™




You can only pay into one cash ISA in the same tax year
Itâ€™s really important that you donâ€™t pay into more than one cash ISA (which includes Help to Buy ISAs) in the same tax year. So if youâ€™ve opened a cash ISA since 6 April 2018, youâ€™ll have to wait until 6 April 2019 to open another one. But if youâ€™ve paid less than Â£20,000 into another type of ISA this tax year - such as a Stocks & Shares, Lifetime or Innovative Finance ISA - youâ€™ll be able to pay into a cash ISA with Monzo this tax year.
To find out more about how ISAs work, read our guide.
You canâ€™t transfer money from an existing ISA
Unfortunately, right now we canâ€™t let you transfer money from an existing cash ISA into an OakNorth one - but itâ€™s something weâ€™re hoping to introduce in the next few months.
Weâ€™ve teamed up with OakNorth to bring you ISAs
Weâ€™re offering ISAs from OakNorth because they offer some of the best savings rates on the market, and are as committed to innovation as we areâ€¦.
And so you know, we earn 0.2% from OakNorth on the money you save.
Weâ€™re working on making Savings Pots available again
In February we had to temporarily stop people from creating new Savings Pots. Theyâ€™d been so popular that we reached our savings limit with our provider Investec sooner than we expected.
Even though weâ€™re launching ISAs, we still canâ€™t let you open regular Savings Pots. Weâ€™re hoping we can make them available again soon, and weâ€™ll let you know when they are.
Your moneyâ€™s protected by the FSCS
Any money you put in a Savings Pot (including a cash ISA) is covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). That covers Â£85,000 across any savings you have with OakNorth through your Monzo account, as well as any money youâ€™ve deposited at OakNorth directly.
Any money in your main Monzo account is also protected up to Â£85,000 by the FSCS, and is separate from your savings.
You can read more about how FSCS protection works here.

What would the estimated balance be after 12 months based on a Â£1,000 deposit?
