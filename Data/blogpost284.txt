Our Community is a huge part of Monzo. Whether it’s on the forum or in person at our events, our community contribute so much to Monzo. That’s why we love inviting you to our office, and meeting people who use Monzo everyday. It’s one way we’re able to get real, unfiltered feedback from customers, and share the exciting stuff we’re working on.
But we know it isn’t possible for everyone to come to our monthly open office events. Our head office is in London, and the majority of our customers aren’t - in fact, over 70% of Monzo customers live outside of London! We livestream them too, but it’s never the same as being there in the flesh. So we host events up and down the country to reach as many of you as possible. This week we got on the road to visit Liverpool and Cardiff.
On Tuesday we were in Liverpool chatting about Designing with Empathy with our friends from Tech for Good Live, The Hut Group and Co-op Digital.
Monzo’s Head of Design, Hugo Cornejo, spoke about what goes into turning diverse, real-life problems into solutions for people. And the impact digital design has on the way we interact with the world around us.

On Wednesday, we headed to Cardiff (our second home!) to talk to National Numeracy, Britain Thinks and Wealthify about Next Gen Financial Education.
Monzo’s Stuart McFadden (Head of Financial Difficulties) looked at the barriers vulnerable and underprivileged groups face to financial literacy.  And why education, corporate responsibility and finding innovative solutions through tech are so important to Monzo.
Here’s what we had to say:
