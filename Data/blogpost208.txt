As part of the Big List, we committed to helping you get interest paid on your savings. And weâ€™re working to let you create a Pot thatâ€™ll pay a competitive rate of interest.
Weâ€™re going to miss tomorrowâ€™s deadline for the Big List, but weâ€™ll be ready to roll it out to everyone in the next few weeks!
How itâ€™ll work
Youâ€™ll be able to create a special kind of pot that lets you earn interest on the money inside it.
Youâ€™ll be able to do this for one pot at a time, and earn interest on savings of Â£1,000 or more. And your money will be protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) up to Â£85,000.
Hereâ€™s how we think itâ€™ll look:



Whatâ€™s next?
Weâ€™ve been working with a partner bank thatâ€™ll help us pay interest on your savings. When you earn interest on a savings pot, your money will actually held by our partner bank.
Weâ€™ve already designed and built the experience, but tracking how money moves between banks is technically complex, so weâ€™re still finishing work on this part.
The good news is that weâ€™ll be ready to roll savings out to everyone in a few weeks! So stay tuned on the blog and Twitter for updates! ðŸ”œ
