This has been an incredible year. We’ve grown our customer base from less than 100,000 people to nearly half a million, gained a full banking licence, started to roll out our full current account and continued to launch more exciting new features.
Today, we’re excited to announce we have closed our latest fundraising round, raising £71 million from Goodwater Capital, Stripe and Michael Moritz, through his charitable investment vehicles including the Crankstart Foundation. They join our existing investors Passion Capital, Thrive Capital and Orange Digital Ventures, who have each made follow-on investments.
This is an incredible endorsement of our strategy so far, and we’re so excited about the opportunities this investment unlocks. Ultimately, this means we can continue the growth we’ve seen so far into 2018 and build on our mission to bring Monzo to as many people as possible, in the UK and beyond!
We also want to make sure that crowd investors are still able to be a part of this round, and have set aside £1.5 million to allow previous crowd investors to do so. If you have previously invested in Monzo through our crowdfunding rounds, look out for an email from Crowdcube later today with all the details.
For those of you who weren’t able to invest in previous crowdfunding rounds, we’ve already begun work on a new crowdfunding campaign for 2018! We’re aiming to ensure that everyone who wants to invest will be able to, and we have a few tricks up our sleeves to make that happen. More news on that next year 😉
This has been a giant year for Monzo and we can’t wait to get started on what’s next. Thank you to everyone who has supported us and helped us get this far — we couldn’t have done it without you ❤️
