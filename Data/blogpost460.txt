Since launching our Alpha back in 2015, one of the most requested features from our community has been a powerful budgeting tool.  Some of you may have already tried our first version of this, our new Targets feature, which we released earlier this month. Although itâ€™s only on iOS at the moment (coming soon to Android!), this feature is just the start of how we think Monzo can develop.
Weâ€™re really excited about bringing you a simple and efficient platform to manage your everyday finances, and thought that we could test the power of Targets over the next few weeks and months ðŸ™‚

Introducing the #MyMonzoMonth Challenge
Budgeting always makes more sense when you have something to work towards. As a community of big thinkers we hope Targets will help you take a step closer to whatever that goal is, no matter how ambitious!
To showcase how Monzo can help with budgeting, for the month of October weâ€™ve challenged three members of our fantastic community to cut back on their average monthly spend with the help of our spending Targets feature.
Whatâ€™s more, we thought we should reward their efforts and give them a bit of a goal. Whatever they save, weâ€™ll donate to a charity of their choice! ðŸ˜‡
But are they up to the challenge? Meet them and decide for yourself:

Jordan Drew, Filmmaker/Head of Video Production
Filmmaker Jordan Drew has his hands full with trips to Toronto and Las Vegas planned before the end of the month. Heâ€™s made budgeting on the road look like a breeze so far, squeezing in a trip to Wales, a tattoo and a game of laser tag between shoots in various weird and wonderful locations across the UK ðŸ˜Ž
Average spend per week: Â£115
Hoping to save per week: Â£40
Charity of choice: Mind
I spend far too much on: Camera accessories and coffee shops!

Tim Chung, Freelance Creative Designer
Tim Chung is no stranger to this #MyMonzoMonth malarkey. He caught our attention with a series of short videos and tweets chronicling his very own version. Timâ€™s decided to eat vegan this October so thereâ€™s every chance the â€˜Less Meat, More Monzoâ€™ mantra could pave the way to success! ðŸ‘Œ
Average spend per week: Â£250
Hoping to save per week: Â£105
Charity of choice: Camp Sonshine Portugal
I spend far too much on: Shopping and Eating Out

Tom Dolan, Monzo Treasurer
In addition to all-things-finance at Monzo, Tom also runs two gyms which keep him super busy. Ever the man of mystery, heâ€™s keeping a tight lid on his plan for #MyMonzoMonth, but weâ€™ve no doubt Tomâ€™s experience as treasurer may give him a bit of an advantage in the final stretch ðŸ‘€ ðŸ’ª
Average spend per week: Â£350
Hoping to save per week: Â£150
Charity of choice: Macmillan
I spend far too much on: Food & gadgets

So itâ€™s mid-month already, and our challengers are doing pretty well against their targets. Hereâ€™s how their spending is looking as of today:
