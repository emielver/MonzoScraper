Weâ€™re building a bank, for and with our customers. And our community has played a crucial part in making Monzo what it is today. Through your support, energy and honest feedback, you hold us accountable and help us focus on what matters. In short, you help us build a better bank.
When you choose to bank with Monzo, you invest your time and trust in us. So we think you should have a chance to share in our future success too.
Through our last two rounds of crowdfunding, 7,395 people invested their money in Monzo. Itâ€™s incredible that so many people have been able to invest, but we also know lots of you missed out.
So, weâ€™re excited to say that weâ€™re doing a much bigger round of crowdfunding, to give as many people as possible the chance to invest!
Next week, weâ€™re crowdfunding up to Â£20,000,000 and eligible customers will be able to invest up to Â£2,000 through the Monzo app.
Head to monzo.com/invest for all the details, including how you can invest and what youâ€™ll get if you do.

If youâ€™re planning to use money thatâ€™s currently in a Savings Pot, remember to move it back into your account at least 24 hours before you invest.
Thanks to all of you for investing your time and trust in us. Youâ€™ve helped us make Monzo into what it is today, and weâ€™re excited for whatâ€™s next ðŸš€
