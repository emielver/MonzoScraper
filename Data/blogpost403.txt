Hot on the heels of launching Android Pay on Monzo.me, weâ€™ve just released a new update to the Android app that lets you top up with Android Pay!



If you have a debit card stored in your Android Pay app, you should now see an additional button on the top up screen. Tap it, select your card and tada â€” youâ€™re now all topped up ðŸŽ‰ If you donâ€™t see the button, make sure youâ€™ve added a debit card to Android Pay.
Get this update by visiting the Google Play Store today and if you fancy leaving a review while youâ€™re at it, we wouldnâ€™t complain!
