The numbers are in! Just over a month ago we closed pre-registration for our latest crowdfunding round and began the process of selecting successful investors at random from the 41,267 people who had pledged. All the money has now been collected and we have a detailed overview of the campaign. Many of our community were keen to see a breakdown of this information, so as promised, here’s a visual summary of these details.



We certainly hope this won’t be our last crowdfunding round. There’s so much more we want to achieve and we look forward to involving the community every step of the way. Beyond financial involvement, we’re so grateful for the time and effort our community has invested in helping to create a banking experience we can all be proud of.
It’s been a momentous start to 2017: share your hopes for the future of Monzo with us via the forum and find more ways to connect with the community on our Community page
