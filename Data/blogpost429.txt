Title: Invest in Monzo: Launching Our Crowdfunding!
Author: Tristan Thomas
Position: Product Manager
Date: 28 Feb 2017





Today weâ€™re launching our Â£2.5 million crowdfunding round, as the final part of our most recent investment raise of Â£22 million! ðŸŽ‰
Last year, we raised Â£1 million in an incredible 96 seconds. Thank you so much to everyone who invested then â€” weâ€™re so lucky and grateful to have you onboard. However, the overwhelming demand last year meant that many people missed out, even when they were just a couple of minutes late. So, this year, we wanted to take steps to make the process better and give as many people as possible a fair chance to invest.
From now until midday on March 14th, you can pre-register for the crowdfunding round and pledge the amount you would like to invest, all through the Monzo apps on iOS and Android. It takes just a couple of minutes.



The pre-registration and pledge flow in the app


In the app youâ€™ll get full access to our investment deck with even more information and a full schedule. Once you pledge, youâ€™ll receive an email confirming your pre-registration and youâ€™ll be all set.
Then, if more than Â£2.5 million is pledged, on March 14th weâ€™ll run a random ballot to select the investors. If youâ€™re successful in the ballot, youâ€™ll receive an email with a link to our Crowdcube pitch page and youâ€™ll have 48 hours to complete your investment through Crowdcube. If you donâ€™t complete within 48 hours, weâ€™ll open your space up to another person from the random ballot.
Perks
To say thank you, all eligible investors this year will receive:








Early access to the Monzo current account when it launches later this year â€” be one of the first members of the public to move over to current accounts!

An exclusive Monzo â€˜Investorâ€™ debit card â€” when your full debit card arrives with your current account, itâ€™ll be â€˜Investorâ€™ branded and if you ever lose it, weâ€™ll replace it with a brand new Investor card!

Live progress
Whether you plan to invest or not, you can follow along with our live progress towards our goal of raising Â£2.5 million at monzo.com/invest/. Please share and tell your friends!
Existing investors
If you invested in our crowdfunding round last year (in March 2016) youâ€™ll automatically be eligible to invest again this time if youâ€™d like. Youâ€™ll still need to pre-register and pledge the amount youâ€™d like to invest, but you wonâ€™t enter the random ballot. On March 14th, weâ€™ll email you with full details on how to complete your investment through Crowdcube.
Thank you
Weâ€™d love you to invest and help support Monzo on our journey to create the worldâ€™s best current account. You can do that anytime between now and midday on March 14th through the Monzo iOS app, Android app or through the Crowdcube pre-registration page. It means so much to us to involve our community this deeply in Monzo and weâ€™d love to continue crowdfunding in the future, so if you canâ€™t invest this time â€” donâ€™t panic.
If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with us on Twitter, Facebook or on the community forum. Weâ€™d love to chat!
