 We’ve had a fantastic time catching up with the Monzo community in Edinburgh, Bristol and Manchester over the last few months. You’ve made us feel so welcome and inspired great discussion around some of the big ideas we’d love to work on. These meetups have cemented our commitment to keep spreading the word across the UK this year.
But planning events from 100 miles away isn’t easy and so we’d love to help you organise meetups in your city! There’s tonnes of potential for awesome events led by you and supported by us.
If you’re passionate about starting conversations with the wider community, we want to hear from you. Create a platform to showcase the most exciting and inspiring community focused projects and ideas your city has to offer, with our help. Whether it’s a box of Monzo swag, promotion through our community network or a couple of Monzo team members to come along and help — talk to us about your idea and what you need to make it happen!
In our experience, some of the most successful events have begun with a conversation. Talking with and listening to community has helped us to understand how we can create something relevant and engaging. With this in mind, the community forum  is a great place to head for some initial research and inspiration.
The better connected the community are, the more ambitious we can be. Imagine hopping off the train for a long weekend in a city for the first time, only to be greeted with a list of unique events and interesting discoveries curated by other Monzo users. This is the experience we want to create in collaboration with you, our community. Climb aboard and help us make it a reality!
We can’t wait to hear from you. Whether it’s on your own or a group of you wanting to host a meetup, contact us directly via email and crowdsource suggestions to make them even more amazing via the community forum.
