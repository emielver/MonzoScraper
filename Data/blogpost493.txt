More than £80,000 is now spent every day through Mondo across the world, with zero fees or charges. It’s amazing to see Mondo users spending across the world and constantly visiting new merchants for us to enrich through crowdsourcing.



We want to share more interesting graphics along these lines – let us know in the community forum what you would like to see in the future. If you already have a Mondo card, you can see your own breakdown through the Your Spending screen in the app – we’d love to know how it compares!

We recently updated our name to Monzo! Read more about it here.
