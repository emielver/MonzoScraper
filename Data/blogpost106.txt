Golden Tickets are the perfect way to invite your friends to Monzo! Theyâ€™re a special link you can share to help them open a Monzo account easily. And youâ€™ll both get a Â£5 reward when they sign up!
How do I get one?
All existing Monzo customers have Golden Tickets to share with their friends ðŸŽ«
To send someone a Golden Ticket:

Head to the Payments tab in your app
Tap â€˜Invite friendsâ€™, or tap the Golden Ticket icon in the top right-hand corner of your screen

How do I share one?
You can either invite a contact from your list, or tap to share your personalised link with a friend over text, email or your favourite messaging app.
How do I use one?
If someoneâ€™s sent you a Golden Ticket (lucky you!) you can use it to set up a Monzo account, and get Â£5 when you first spend on your Monzo card.

Tap on the link youâ€™ve been sent
Enter your email address to claim your Â£5 reward
Download the Monzo app, and sign up using the same email address

Why do you have them?
We originally started giving out Golden Tickets because there was a waiting list for Monzo. They let existing Monzo users invite their friends and help them skip the queue.
Weâ€™re happy to say that thereâ€™s no longer a waiting list to sign up to Monzo, but weâ€™ve kept Golden Tickets around so you can keep inviting your friends to Monzo easily, and get a reward when you do ðŸ˜ƒ
