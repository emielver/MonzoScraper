Title: Launching the Monzo Shop 👕

We love t-shirts! Employees have always been given the famous Monzo M t-shirt when they join and we’ve had thousands (well, maybe hundreds) of requests from our community for them. Our early hackathon winners won limited edition hoodies, as did the six people who suggested our new name, but we wanted to get everyone on board and share the love 😍
So today, we’re launching the Monzo Shop with a whole range of t-shirts (and a hoody) in different colors and styles to suit everyone!
We’ve teamed up with the wonderful people over at Teemill, who’ll print, package and post your items, as well as deal with any issues you have. We chose them for a variety of reasons, not least their commitment to sustainability and ethics. All of the items are made from certified organic cotton or bamboo in an ethically accredited, wind powered factory. You can trace each item from ‘Seed to shop’ to see how your t-shirt is made and Teemill are more than happy to answer any questions you have!
Each item sold also makes a small profit, all of which we’ll donate to charity. Based on an internal vote, we’ve chosen to support Turn2us, a national charity that helps people in financial hardship gain access to welfare benefits, charitable grants and support services, and make our small contribution to their amazing work.

We can’t wait to see Monzo out and about! We’d love to expand the shop over the coming months to bring in more products and designs, so please let us know what you’d like to see over on Twitter or on our forum 😄
