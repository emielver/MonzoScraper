Before we look ahead to the exciting things 2018 has in store, we thought we’d take some time to reflect on the year gone by.
2017 saw us earn our banking licence, build a current account, and bring Monzo to almost half a million people. There’s been plenty to celebrate, and a few things that haven’t gone as well as we’d have liked. We’ve definitely learnt a lot in the last year, and we can’t wait for what the next one will bring.
Thanks to everyone who’s supported us (even when the road’s been rocky!) We couldn’t have done it without you ❤️
