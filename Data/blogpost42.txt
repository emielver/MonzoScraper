Yesterday we added the ability to pick your own images for your Pots on Android, after bringing this to iOS a few weeks ago. And you’ve truly outdone yourselves.
You’ve been saving up for something special

Add your own images to your Pots
To get started, just open your Monzo app and head to the Account tab to see your Pots.
Tap on the Pot, tap ‘Edit Pot’, then tap the image you want to change. Then just choose any image from your phone’s camera roll!
