Title: Set goals for your Pots!

A couple of weeks ago, we released Pots Goals into Monzo Labs to hear what you thought and find any bugs we missed in testing.
You gave us lots of really useful feedback, and weâ€™ve made some improvements as a result.
Today, Pots Goals are graduating from Labs and are now available in everybodyâ€™s apps!



How it works
You can set goals for existing pots or add them to brand new ones. Just create a new pot or edit an existing one from the Account tab.
Weâ€™ll show you the goal for each pot underneath the amount youâ€™ve saved so far. And you can also track how youâ€™re doing with a progress bar.
Once you reach your goal, weâ€™ll let you know so you can celebrate!
Give us your feedback
Weâ€™ll keep improving Pots Goals based on your feedback, so please let us know what you think on the community forum! And share which goals you successfully hit ðŸŽ‰
