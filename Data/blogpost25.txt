People in the UK gave more than £10 billion to charity last year, and 65% of people give money to charity through donations or sponsorship. But according to the Charities Aid Foundation, that number’s been falling for the last three years.
What do you think about giving?
We asked you whether you give money to charity. And if you do, which ones you support. Here’s what you told us.
You give to local causes
They say charity begins at home!

generally charities that support homeless people. Most recently these have been small charities like @ASSISTSheffield and @MASHManchester I like to support local! Used to live in Sheff, now live in Manc.— Frances B (@Frances_M_B) May 3, 2019



By DD to Wales Air Ambulance. Vital unfunded service in rural Wales..— Yveline Hands (@Nantaise) May 4, 2019



Each month I give to two local charities through Local Giving and also to Water Aid.— Abigail Rumsey 🇪🇺 (@Abbie2020) May 3, 2019



£5 a month to my local hospice which is deducted from my wage— Fiona P (@miss_run_tings) May 3, 2019


You sponsor friends and family (or fundraise yourselves)
It’s no surprise that sponsorship increases over summer, when all the marathon runners and sponsored swimmers get going.

I try and support family and friends' fundraisers when they come up. I find it hard to choose a cause to support, so I help the people around me with theirs :)— Aaron (@aaroncawte) May 3, 2019



I donate to @mountrescueuk quarterly because the volunteers do incredible work to keep people in the outdoors safe and then contribute to another charity (or friend’s fundraising page) perhaps monthly.— Mark Rickaby (@markrickaby) May 3, 2019



I’ve run the @LondonMarathon twice for @CwC_UK plus I randomly sponsor other people’s fundraising for other cancer charities. My daughter was diagnosed with Leukaemia in 2015— Richard Wilson (@richardajwilson) May 3, 2019


You care about the animals!
Along with charities that support children, animal welfare was the most popular cause people in the UK supported in 2018. From endangered animals to dogs and even frogs, you told us you give to animal charities.

RSPCA. Because dogs > humans— Brentmeister (@newelly89) May 3, 2019

I have a dd to @DogsTrust . I support all animal charities. My friend and I raise money at the great north dog walk for SHAK a local dog welfare charity and I also try to help @animalhserescue as much as I can too. I love animals. People not so much!— D (@picnicspotlover) May 4, 2019



Every month I give a few bob to @wwf_uk and @mcsuk because they're great causes :)— Louis Otto (@louisotto) May 3, 2019



RSPB, Woodland Trust and Friends of the Earth. I give £10 monthly donations except to Woodland Trust where I pay for a yearly joint membership. It's pretty obvious why I've chosen these charities. They do great conservation work and help is save the planet.— Samantha Zoe Bird (@SamanthaZoeBird) May 3, 2019



@froglifers are a great charity, not only helping conserve wildlife across the UK but they focus on working with disadvantaged groups and places to execute their work!— Emily (@JustEmz) May 4, 2019



StJude and cats protection! A lot... StJude is one month a year (many in the month) and cats protection is every month to my local one. I donate because I can’t have a cat and also my favourite twitch streamer does StJude fundraising.— Rachel 🏳️‍🌈 (@RachelxAleks) May 3, 2019


You fund medical research and care
Medical research, hospitals or hospices were two more of the most popular causes to support in 2018. You also told us that supporting scientific research or helping people get medical help was important to you.

Cancer Research (diagnosed myself) and Help for Heroes (family vets and generally appreciate their sacrifices) are my usual choices.— James Kennedy (@SmoothskinJim) May 4, 2019



@AnthonyNolan each month. Little boy I knew when I was growing up died from leukaemia. I got to donate stem cells last year.— iPaddle (@PaddlerMike) May 3, 2019



@GOSHCharity !— Tasha Morrison (@TashaMorrison96) May 3, 2019



£10 a month to @GOSHCharity— thePerson (@theshetty) May 3, 2019


And you want to help people in poverty

I donate to @ActionAidUK once a month to buy girls in poverty period packs— Amy Jones (@amyjldn) May 4, 2019


You support LGBTQA+ charities
🏳️‍🌈

£10 to @Mermaids_Gender and £10 to @SpecialEffect every month; it's literally the least I can do— Chad (@kitation) May 3, 2019



@PrideInLondon 🏳️‍🌈— Thomas Wales (@thomaswales) May 3, 2019



Give a small (£5) to a Romanian dogs charity monthly. It’s a small amount and the least I can do. I’ve made crowdfund donations to trans people for medical needs and am now going to follow @kitation’s donation to @Mermaids_Gender— Benjamin Mackay (@benjmackay) May 3, 2019



Not fixed amount. Amazon Smile set to @lgbtHERO/@GMFA_UK. Other HIV, sexual health or trans orgs on an hoc basis. The reason they get my money is to help combat the effects of stigma and ignorance stemming from the misrepresentation/negative portrayal in the main stream media.— Trans man on PrEP 🏳️‍🌈💙⚒️ (@0hJamie) May 3, 2019


Some of you donate to a few different causes
Lots of you have multiple charities you want to support.

£3 Dogs Trust = doggos £3 = WDCS = dolphins/whales and £3 Cancer Research = Cancer sucks— ☾𝖍𝖆𝖞𝖑𝖊𝖞 (@__hatherell) May 3, 2019



Today is the start of the Islamic month of Ramadan, during this time muslims give much charity both to Islamic and humanitarian causes both locally and abroad, personally I give to Shelter, DEC and Islamic Relief.— Raja (@londontide) May 6, 2019



Once a month (direct from payroll so they get the full amount without worrying about reclaiming on tax returns etc.) I've recently increased it to £100 and split it between a variety of charities which I do change periodically depending on who I want to support— Stewart X Addison 🇪🇺 (@sxaTech) May 3, 2019



I give to @wearebeam, @HelpRefugees and @StMungos. ~6% of income total monthly. Charities I trust (having done some research on charity efficacy), doing good.— Ryan Bateman (@rynbtmn) May 3, 2019



Yes ad hoc @ARCAnimalRescue a small local charity rescuing & rehoming unwanted animals; ad-hoc @feedbackorg  who campaign to fix our broken food system; monthly @WorldVisionUK & annually @amnesty to give a tiny bit back re all the wonderful travel experiences I've had in my life— Kate Rodde (@KamaroConsult) May 3, 2019



I decided a year ago to start donating £2 per month to a different charity each year. But then instead of cancelling the direct debits after a year, I've decided just to add a new charity on each year. Currently it's Cancer Research UK and Mind.— Joe (@itsjoerack) May 3, 2019



£5 for @savechildrenuk & £5 @CR_UK  Monthly... No specific reasons just wanna be part of something good.— thushi (@thushi997) May 3, 2019


You’ve found creative ways to donate
Finding extra cash to donate isn’t always easy. But you’ve come up with some clever ways to find room in your budgets to give.

so I made a swearing pot on monzo. this ramadan every time I say a bad word I’m adding £1 to the pot. at the end of the month I’m giving it to charity🥺 pic.twitter.com/x5IYKTooX1— intí (@mscrispss) May 6, 2019



Not fixed amount. Amazon Smile set to @lgbtHERO/@GMFA_UK. Other HIV, sexual health or trans orgs on an hoc basis. The reason they get my money is to help combat the effects of stigma and ignorance stemming from the misrepresentation/negative portrayal in the main stream media.— Trans man on PrEP 🏳️‍🌈💙⚒️ (@0hJamie) May 3, 2019



Not a set amount, all my Amazon orders are through Amazon Smile and my donation goes to @CR_UK, I donate to friends and family when doing fun runs etc. CRUK will always get my support, without them I might not have survived my cancer.— Daniel P (@dparv) May 3, 2019



Every year the money I estimate what I’d spend on Christmas cards for friends and colleagues, which I then donate to @GOSHCharity instead of sending the cards.  Other than that @PoppyLegion and various others on an adhoc basis.— Alan Glenister MBCS (@ukahg) May 3, 2019



I donate to @MindCharity through @Savoo, so every time I buy something or use their search engine I give a little extra change to this great charity :)— Izzy Grimshaw (@IzzyOnABudget) May 7, 2019


And some of you donate your time instead
Giving back doesn’t just mean giving money!

I donate to @artsemergency as well as volunteering as a mentor. They support young people getting into the arts, and creating 'privilege' for those not born with it. As someone whose privileged background got me to where I am today, this is something I'm really passionate about!— Alex Jones (@JonesAlexM) May 3, 2019



well, i still prefer to volunteer rather than give money— Elena Aganova (@DesignAganova) May 3, 2019
