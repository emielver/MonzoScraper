Title: #MonzoJournals - Philippines

We want travelling with Monzo to be fuss-free, even delightful.
That’s why we’re really looking forward to launching the travel reports feature publicly as part of version 1.7, later this week. In addition to fee-free withdrawals abroad, you’ll receive a neatly packaged little report when you touchdown on home turf, detailing how much you’ve spent and the exchange rates while you were away.



A shared love of travel and a thirst for adventure amongst the Monzo community mean that we’re excited about how these features might improve your experience travelling with the app. In celebration, we’ll be presenting a series of #MonzoJournals on the blog, combining spending data and recommendations from our users to bring you a mini travel guide to a different destination each month.
If you’re planning a trip, you can also read up on using Monzo abroad in the new ‘Travelling with Monzo’ section on our forum, which features tips and reviews from across our community.
#MonzoJournals from the Philippines
For our inaugural #MonzoJournals, Dave Weatherall of That Travel Blog has selected his visitor highlights from the city of Cebu in the Philippines.



Even though the Philippines are almost 7,000 miles away, we’ve had lots of people using Monzo there, spending over £8,000 between them on their cards.



Hey Monzo members! I’m Dave from That Travel Blog. I am a location independent entrepreneur who has been enjoying my Monzo card while working and travelling around the world.
If you have plans to come to Cebu, in the Philippines (and you should!), here are my top recommendations:
The IT Park -
The IT Park is a great place to explore for shopping and dining as it’s open until late, with a peaceful restaurant plaza nearby called The Walk.
The Golden Cowrie -
The first place I visited was the highly recommended Golden Cowrie restaurant. Their speciality is lechon (roasted suckling pig), sizzling fish and unlimited rice. The food was extremely tasty and I was able to pay for the meal with my Monzo card 💸
Malapascua Island -
The journey itself was breathtaking. Open waters, islands views, cool air and soles of leaping flying fish! Gibitngil, aptly named “Funtastic” by the locals is an even smaller island near Malapascua which is a worthwhile visit if you are staying in either Daanbantayan or Medellin. You can hire a cottage for the day for just P135 (~£2). There’s plenty to do including cliff-to-rock zip lining, kayaking, snorkelling, plus a 40-foot cliff diving platform (sorry Mum)!
