Title: An Update on our Alpha Rollout
Author: Tristan Thomas
Position: Community Manager
Date: 14 Jan 2016


Back in November, we announced the beginning of our Alpha Preview with space for 500 Alphas. Weâ€™ve now given out all 500 and testing has been fantasticâ€”Mondo has now been used in over 50 different countries and over 3,800 different retailers!



Whatâ€™s next?
We have a limited run of 2500 more Alpha accounts ready to go with improvements weâ€™ve made as a result of feedback from the first Alphas. This afternoon we are sending out invites for more than 1000 of these places to our waiting listâ€”you can register for the waiting list on our homepage.



      In the UK and want to try it out?
    










The Alpha is a limited edition print run with a unique designâ€”once theyâ€™re gone, theyâ€™re gone. After that, weâ€™ll move into a broader Beta trial with all of the feedback weâ€™ve gathered over the past months.
Available across the UK!
Mondo will be going on an Alpha roadshow with accounts to give out in major cities across the UK. You can vote for Mondo to come to your city at monzo.com/voteâ€”weâ€™d love to meet you all! #BringMeMondo ðŸ˜€
What is an Alpha?
Everything we said in November still applies and I encourage you to read that post to understand why weâ€™re doing an Alpha test and what that means in practice here. Itâ€™s important to remember we are not a bank yetâ€”your testing is helping us build one!
Weâ€™d love to have you on board. You can sign up to the waiting list at monzo.com and follow us @getmondo. Please email us anytime at [emailÂ protected] with ideas, suggestions or questionsâ€”we read and reply to every one!

We recently updated our name to Monzo! Read more about it here.
