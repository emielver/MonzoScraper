If you donâ€™t have a fixed address, getting a bank account can be tricky. Because traditional banks usually ask you to provide proof of address, like a council tax or bank statement.
Weâ€™ve tried to make it simple to get a bank account with Monzo, even if you donâ€™t have a permanent address.





Download the Monzo app on iOS or Android and start signing up.

Youâ€™ll need some form of ID to hand â€” that could be:
    
a passport
a driving licence (provisional or full)
a government issued photo ID (from the UK or abroad)


During signup weâ€™ll ask you for an address. If you donâ€™t have a permanent address then you can use another address that you have access to, like:
    
Your work address
Your parentsâ€™ address
A friendâ€™s address (if you have their permission!)
A local organisation that will let you use their address (like a church, shelter or charity)
If youâ€™re not staying at your permanent address at the moment, then still enter your permanent address. Youâ€™ll be able to get your card delivered to a different address later


Finish signup and your debit card will arrive at your delivery address within a day or two! Once it arrives, just activate the card to start using your Monzo bank account

If you donâ€™t have access to any address at all, we canâ€™t currently get you a Monzo account â€” which we know isnâ€™t good enough. Weâ€™re working hard to find a way to get you an account even without an address and will update this post as soon as we do that.

Weâ€™ve outlined ways weâ€™re trying to help people traditionally excluded from financial services get access to bank accounts, as easily and quickly as possible. Thatâ€™s bank accounts for immigrants, bank accounts for refugees and bank accounts for people who live on boats.
