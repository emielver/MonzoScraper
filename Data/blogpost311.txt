To help you sort through, search and better organise your spending, we’ve added the ability to add tags to your transactions! It’s available on both Android and iOS from today.
Adding a tag is easy:

Go to your feed and tap on the transaction you want to tag
Tap on “Add notes and #tags”
Then add as many tags as you need!

Just search for or tap on a tag to see all your other tagged transactions.



Adding the ability to create your own payment categories has been a popular request from our community, so we know that loads of you would like the option to organise transactions in your own way.
Tags work in a similar way to categories, but you’re completely in control of what they’re called, and which payments they belong to.
So if your cat food, treats and toys don’t fall neatly into one category, add the tag #pets to keep track of how much you spend on your furry friend.
As always, we’ll automatically put your transactions into categories, like Transport, Groceries Entertainment or Bills, to help you see your spending breakdowns and set targets, without doing any of the admin.

Give it a try! Let us know what you think and how you’re using it on the forum.
We added this feature based on feedback and ideas from our community. Have your say on what else we can do to improve Monzo 💡
