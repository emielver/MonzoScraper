Title: The dog ate my Mondo card...

Eleanor the puppy didnâ€™t mean any harm. She was busy enjoying another carefree canine day when she came across a brightly coloured, hot coral piece of plastic. Surely another fun thing to play with?
Er, no. It was Nickâ€™s Mondo card.



Thankfully when Nick got out of the shower to find his card had been chewed up, he didnâ€™t have to go to a bank branch or fill out paperwork to get a new one. Heâ€™s using Mondo, so it was quick, easy and on his smartphone.
Once heâ€™d gone into the app and opened up the â€˜Your cardâ€™ screen, he tapped â€˜Freeze card temporarilyâ€™and â€˜Order a Replacement Cardâ€™.



His request was heard. A crack team at Mondo HQ was assembled and a new card was winging its way to him (via Royal Mail) the very same day.
So far Nickâ€™s second card is safe, but maybe itâ€™s only a matter of time before it needs replacing againâ€¦
