As of this week, more than Â£15 million has been spent with Mondo. Of that, almost Â£10 million has been spent in the UK, Â£3 million spent online, and around Â£2.5 million spent abroad.
In fact, Mondonauts have been busy accumulating lots of air miles, flying across the planet and spending in 132 countries. ðŸ›«
After the UK, the United States is where weâ€™ve spent the most - over Â£450,000 so far (thatâ€™s about $587,000 using todayâ€™s exchange rate!).
If youâ€™re planning a trip abroad this summer, remember you can use your Mondo card with no fees at point of sale or at ATMs, plus we currently pass on Mastercardâ€™s exchange rate (read Emmaâ€™s recent blog post for more).
