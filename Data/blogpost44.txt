The 1p Saving Challenge involves saving a little money every day, starting with 1p. The next day you save 2p, the day after 3p. After a year, you’ll be setting aside £3.65 on the final day and have a total of £667.95 in savings! In a leap year, you’ll save £671.61.
By setting money aside little and often, the idea is that you’ll find it easier to make room in your budget for saving, and start a habit you’ll hopefully continue.
The challenge has been popularised by bloggers like Skint Dad and the Monzo Community love it!
