Last week we added the ability to pick your own images for your Pots on iOS, and you’ve been taking full advantage of the new feature.
You’ve been preparing in this time of political uncertainty
Help.

Add your own images to your Pots on iOS
To get started, just open your Monzo app and head to the Account tab to see your Pots.
Tap on the Pot, tap ‘Edit Pot’, then tap the image you want to change. Then just choose any image from your phone’s camera roll!
We’ll be bringing this feature to Android in the next few weeks, so stay tuned for updates!
