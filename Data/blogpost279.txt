I lived on a houseboat on the canals of London for about a year. And as well as learning to light a fire, I also discovered a new world of “life admin.” Things like registering to vote, receiving post and (most importantly) getting takeaway delivered all turned into much trickier tasks.



Opening a bank account can be tiresome and stressful at the best of times. But if you don’t have a fixed address because you live on a boat, it can become even more complex.
We believe basic financial services like bank accounts should be available to everyone, even if your situation’s unusual!
How to open a bank account if you live on a boat

Download the Monzo app on iOS or Android and start signing up. You’ll need your passport or driving licence to hand.
During the signup process, we’ll ask for your address. Enter an address you have access to, like:
Your work address
Your parents’ address
A friend’s address (if you have their permission!)
Finish signup and your debit card will arrive to that address within a day or two! Once it arrives, just activate the card to start using your Monzo bank account.

If you live on a boat in the UK and have any questions, please email us at [email protected] and we’ll do everything we can to help.

We thought you’d enjoy some of the title suggestions that were turned down for this post, in the spirit of full transparency. You missed out on Oarsome Banking, Setting sail with Monzo and finally, Canal You Get An Account with Monzo.
