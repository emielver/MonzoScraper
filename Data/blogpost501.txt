Title: We Have Temporarily Paused our Crowdcube Round

Position: Mondo CEO
Date: 29 Feb 2016


Updated 2nd March: We now have a plan that we hope is reliable and fair to everyone and have emailed everyone who received the original launch email on Monday. In summary, pre-registrants will have access to the full £1m round instead of the £500k we’d previously reserved. On Thursday at 12pm we will email a link asking how much individuals would like to invest. If you enter your details, Crowdcube will email you with further details about how to complete the investment process afterwards.
I’d like to personally apologise to everyone who has tried to get access to the investment today. I know it’s been a frustrating and confusing experience so far.
Unfortunately, the level of demand to participate in Mondo’s crowdfunding has overwhelmed Crowdcube’s servers, and so we’ve taken the decision to temporarily pause the campaign. Once we’re happy that their servers are prepared to handle the load, we will restart the campaign and email you a private link before it goes live to the public. We hope to have an exact time for that tomorrow (Tuesday March 1st).
If you managed to invest money before the site went down, that investment will be honoured (up to a maximum of £1,000 per person).  For anyone who has inadvertently invested multiple times, Crowdcube will be in touch to rectify the situation. No money will be taken from your card before then. If you are worried, please get in touch with them at [email protected]
Again, we’re very sorry and apologise for the confusion that’s been caused. Thank you for your patience and enthusiasm.
– Tom
CEO of Mondo
