Title: New Monzo Update: Card Replacement on Android
Author: Tristan Thomas

Weâ€™ve just released version 1.1.5 of the Android app to the Google Play Store with a small, but incredibly useful feature for that horrible moment when you realise youâ€™ve lost your Monzo card.
Weâ€™re really proud of our Freeze feature, that lets you temporarily freeze your card if it goes missing and stop all payments going through. When you find your card (normally down the back of the sofa), you can instantly defrost it and start using it again immediately. However, unfortunately it sometimes really is lost and we know that waiting on hold to talk to your bank to order a new one is pretty painfulâ€¦



So now you can order a new card instantly from within the app! If you order it before 4pm Monday to Friday, itâ€™ll be posted that very same day and often will be sitting in your letterbox the next day for you to activate and get straight back to using Monzo. Your old card will also automatically be deactivated so nobody else can use it.
This week weâ€™ve also been working hard on version 1.2, which weâ€™re very excited about! Can you guess what it might be? Our transparent product roadmap might give you a clue ðŸ˜‰ Weâ€™d love to hear what you want to see next on Android in the community forum.
