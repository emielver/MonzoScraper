Yesterday, we announced we were bringing Mondo across the UK on a roadshow and gave everyone outside London the opportunity to vote on Twitter and by email for their city. Within the hour, #BringMeMondo was trending on Twitter in the UK with more than 700 tweets voting with the hashtag in total.


I want @getmondo in Edinburgh! As Scotland's tech hub, this is the best place to try new things! https://t.co/8K6cXsQ4jV #BringMeMondoâ€” Christopher Sladdin (@SladdinCJ) January 14, 2016

Voting has now finished and weâ€™re incredibly excited to say that the next city to #GetMondo will beâ€¦ Manchester!
With more than 85 votes, Manchester was the clear winner and we are now organising to come to Manchester as soon as we canâ€”if you live in Manchester and would like to help us with tips, space or ideas, please get in touch at [emailÂ protected].
Thank you to everyone who voted! Manchester received nearly 50% more votes than their closest competitors Leeds, Bristol and Edinburgh, but weâ€™d love to come to as many of the other top voted cities as we can after Manchester, so watch this spaceâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰

We recently updated our name to Monzo! Read more about it here.
