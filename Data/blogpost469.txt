Weâ€™ve just released an update to the Monzo iOS app with a variety of bug fixes and tweaks to make your life easier. The most notable of these is the new Limits page, which you now can find in your Profile:



From here, you can see your spending and top up limits and how much youâ€™ve used of them. These are the same limits as in our Terms and Conditions, but are now much easier to understand and are personalised to you.
Additionally, if we werenâ€™t able to automatically verify your identity when you signed up, youâ€™ll be able to trigger the ID verification flow and send us a scan of your passport or driving licence, all from within the app in less than a minute. Once weâ€™ve verified your identity youâ€™ll get access to our higher limits, as well as be able to use our Send Money feature and withdraw cash from ATMs abroad.
This release also fixes a ton of bugs that were reported by users and builds in a new A/B testing framework so we can test new features more quickly and easily. Weâ€™re also updating our homepage in the next few days so you can download Monzo instantly without entering your email address and if youâ€™re still waiting for a card, itâ€™s even easier to refer friends to Monzo and bump yourself up the queue.
We also canâ€™t wait to show you what weâ€™ve been working on over the last few weeks, coming in the next update. Letâ€™s just say, soon you wonâ€™t need to use your fingers to send money to friends ðŸ˜‰
