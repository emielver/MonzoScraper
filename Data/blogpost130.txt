It can be tempting to dip into your savings, especially when it only takes a few taps. So, to help you stick to your savings goals, you can now lock your Pots until a date you choose and you won’t be able to take money out till then.
To lock a Pot:

Head to the Account tab in your app

Create a new Pot, or edit an existing one
Choose how long you’d like to lock it for




You’ll be able to put money in your Pot as normal, by adding money manually or scheduling regular payments in.
But if you try to withdraw money from a locked Pot, we’ll remind you that you can’t until the date you set.



By adding some extra friction, we hope you’ll find it easier to control your spending or save towards your goals.
If you still want to remove the money, you can chat to us in the app and we’ll help. But if you just want to try it out, please pick a short time frame so you can access your money again quickly!
